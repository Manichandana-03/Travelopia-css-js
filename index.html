    There are many pagan sites to visit as well as UNESCO World Heritage-listed churches, which are almost without exception built in stunning locations. Surrounded by forests, perched on the top of dramatic gorges or silhouetted before snow-capped mountains, they draw us to magnificent open spaces filled with a huge variety of trees and wild flowers. On Armenia tours we see wonderful mountains, lakes and waterfalls in the countryside and relish cooling breezes while the cafés and restaurants of the country’s capital, Yerevan, are proof of an emerging economy. Mount Ararat towers majestically over the city, and beautiful scenery is plentiful.</span>
